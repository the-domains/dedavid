Vivo en Colombia

As life progresses one sometimes finds oneself in a very foreign country, without being able to speak the language, without any real connections to anything and without a clue of what is your next step.

This week have had a lot of days like these. I arrived to Bogotá tired after more than 24 hours of travels due to delays and long time between flights. Although the energy one gets when entering a completely new continent is immense! Whilst landing with the plane at El Dorado international airport with the mountains as a surrounding I feel thrilled to be alive and on new soil - all on my own. ![Street artists in Bogotá with so much passion and energy](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/039b0fc147a0dbb9abcd702f5856ee89/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3375&cropwidth=6000&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fd09ff150-3d7e-495e-b8de-43bc7cc6588c.jpg&x=0&y=0)
